title: Upstate Theatre Dec. 29 postponed due to weather
---

<p>Members of The Machine are always checking the weather in the Winter months, as we don't want to jeopardize the safety of our crew or our fans.&nbsp; The band members, along with the promoters of the Dec. 29 show at Upstate Concert Hall in Clifton Park, NY, have decided it will be in the best interest of everyone's safety to postpone the show untill Saturday, March 11.&nbsp; While we are sorry for the inconvenience, it is largely for YOUR safety.&nbsp; Tickets for the Dec. 29 show will be honored at the March 11 show.&nbsp; Hope to see you there.</p>

<p>Once the storm passes, why don't you consider driving up to Niagara Falls for our New Year's Eve show.&nbsp; We have not rung in the new year with our fans in a while and it's a beautiful place any time of year.&nbsp; The Rapids Theatre, Niagara Falls, NY.</p>
