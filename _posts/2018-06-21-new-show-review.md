<p>Today the Jamestown Post-Journal ran an excitedly positive review of The Machine's June 15 show with lasers at Salamanca, NY. &nbsp;Critic Chris Chapman said, " The musicianship was solid and the atmosphere was tremendous....They played all the hits you'd expect, and a couple of gems the ardent Floydian would hope to hear. &nbsp;Each musician brings a passion and a persona to their parts."</p>

<p>"With keyboardist Scott Chasolen, the passion is evident in each and every song. &nbsp;His movements simply showed that he was not just there but in tune with his castle of keyboards....Guitarist and vocalist, and founding member Joe Pascarell....[is a] Jerry-Garcia-like avatar....Anyone in attendance had to be impressed with Tahrah Cohen on drums. &nbsp;Not too many can keep up with what she can do on that kit. "</p>

<p>"Visually, The Machine is stunning."</p>

<p>"...this sound, these musicians, were that piece of solace I needed to process everything again, to heal. &nbsp;To feel."</p>
