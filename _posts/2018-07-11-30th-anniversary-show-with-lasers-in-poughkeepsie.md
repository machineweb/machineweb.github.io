title: 30th Anniversary show with lasers in Poughkeepsie
---

<p>Ok, here is one worth driving for:&nbsp; We are performing the 30th Anniversary show at Mid-Hudson Civic Center in Poughkeepsie, NY on&nbsp;Saturday, October 13&nbsp;with an expanded light show and a full-on laser show!&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Animals,&nbsp;</em>all in their entirety, plus more. This could be the greatest show of the fourth quarter and it is well worth driving for. These photos don't do our laser show justice, but this is as close as we can get. Check it out:&nbsp;</p>
