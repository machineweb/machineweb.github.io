<p>Thanks to everyone who made our first-ever holiday show at Sony Hall a smashing&nbsp;success.&nbsp; That 360 degree PA system was killer.&nbsp; We hope we will be back there again in 2019.&nbsp; Very special thanks to everyone who contributed to make our show at The Warehouse at FTC in Fairfield, CT a total sell out in advance.&nbsp; Special thanks to Tim Sheehan, Ethan Carey and the entire crew at I95 radio for all their help.&nbsp;</p>
