title: Yet Another Sell Out!
---

<p>Thanks to the administration, players, and conductor Todd Craven of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra for an incandescent performance at Kleinhans Music Hall Friday, March 3rd. A very special thank you goes out to our Buffalo fans, who sold out this 2,400-seat hall for us.&nbsp; See you again at Artpark on August 22, with an even larger laser show, plus the giant inflatables of Plasticiens Volants. Tickets available <a href="https://www.artpark.net/events/plasticiens-volants-pearl-secrets-of-the-sea-with-the-machine-performs-pink-floyd?fbclid=IwAR0P35qsSA6fWGte61G62BG9kJ_cR-Am8aMHswvlU2Hw6YUqbevpRcfPen4">here</a>.</p>
