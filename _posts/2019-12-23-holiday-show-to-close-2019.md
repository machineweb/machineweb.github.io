<h2>On behalf of The Machine, we&nbsp;want to wish you a peaceful holiday season, and a joyful, hopeful new year. The past two&nbsp;years have seen a lot of changes within the band. With that, as&nbsp;we move into 2020, we're so excited to be presenting such a high quality show;&nbsp;the current band line up and technical crew are riding new highs. We've hit some milestones becuase of your support and we deeply value it. <strong>THANK YOU! </strong>We hope to see you at <strong>SONY Hall in NYC</strong> on Dec 26th &amp; <strong>FTC in Fairfileld, CT</strong> on Dec 27th.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
