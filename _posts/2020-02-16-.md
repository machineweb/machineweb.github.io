<p>Thank you <strong>Florida </strong>for a wonderful tour.. <strong>A few sell outs</strong>, near sell outs and some new venues. Wish we coud have stayed longer. Thankfully, we hear there are already <strong>show dates on hold for 2021!!</strong>&nbsp; Always a blast, thanks to everyone who came out, and thanks to everyone who put&nbsp;their hard work into making this tour happen. Great start to 2020!&nbsp;</p>
